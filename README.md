1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your E*TRADE API credentials:
   ```
   ETRADE_CLIENT_KEY=your_actual_client_key
   ETRADE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
   ETRADE_SANDBOX=true  # Set to false for production

    # Add your growth stocks here

## Authentication Flow

The application uses OAuth 1.0a authentication with E*TRADE:

1. Run the dashboard
2. Browser automatically opens to E*TRADE authorization page
3. Log in to your E*TRADE account
4. Copy the verification code
5. Paste it into the terminal
6. Tokens are cached for up to 12 hours

## Dashboard Sections

### 1. Account Overview (Left Panel)
- Portfolio value with gain/loss
- Net equity with margin utilization
- Margin buying power

- Searchable and sortable

## Configuration Options

The `config.yml` file supports the following settings:

```yaml
settings:
  # Minimum position value to include in report (USD)
  min_position_value: 100
  
  # Display precision
  percentage_precision: 2
  dollar_precision: 2
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure your API credentials are correct in `.env`
- Browser should auto-open; if not, copy/paste the URL manually
- Tokens are cached for up to 12 hours
- If tokens expire, dashboard will prompt for re-authentication

### Dashboard Won't Load
- Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
- Check if port 8501 is available
- Try running: `streamlit run dashboard.py --server.port 8502`

### Missing Positions
- Check the `min_position_value` setting in config.yml
- Verify positions have positive quantities

### Configuration Errors
- Validate YAML syntax in config.yml
- Ensure all required sections are present
- Check symbol formatting (should match E*TRADE symbols exactly)

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API credentials secure
- Use privacy mode when sharing screenshots
- Token cache (`.etrade_tokens.json`) should also be excluded from version control
- Use sandbox mode for testing
